<p>Since my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://evilsocket.net/2016/05/08/Hacking-Yourself-out-of-the-Banking-System-and-Live-only-on-BitCoins/">latest post about BitCoin</a> went viral it also got published on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://qz.com/689365/im-giving-up-traditional-banks-and-living-on-bitcoin-and-you-can-too/">Quartz</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.thememo.com/2016/05/24/ditching-bank-for-bitcoin-blockchain-banks-banking-simone-margaritelli/">The Memo</a> and other various magazines.<br>Some people also asked me to keep writing about this and give them updates about my decision to ditch banks for BitCoin, so here I am :)</p>
<p>Unfortunately I’m still unable to fully avoid banks as I’m moving to another apartment and I need some money in my account, so at least for this month I had to get my wage sent to my main bank account, but within the next 1-2 months I’ll be able to move <strong>all</strong> of my assets to BTC.</p>
<p>In the meantime, here’re some clarifications about my previous post and some more insights/updates.</p>
<span id="more"></span>

<h2 id="My-Current-Setup"><a href="#My-Current-Setup" class="headerlink" title="My Current Setup"></a>My Current Setup</h2><p>After I tried different services I’ve finally decided my final setup, while this is not necessarly the best setup to use, chances are it’s definitely the most secure right now.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2016/05/btc_setup.png" alt="My BitCoin Setup"></p>
<p>As you can see, I configured my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bitwage.com/referral/PSBJCGWMAR4O">BitWage</a> account to receive the monthly paychecks from my employer ( I gave my employer the bank coordinates that BitWage provided me, he didn’t have to start using bitwage or any other platform rather than his usual banking system ) which are automatically converted to BTC and eventually sent directly to my Trezor hardware wallet.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2016/05/bitwage.png" alt="Wage being sent to my BTC address"></p>
<p>Once I have the BTC safely stored on my wallet, I move the quantity I need to spend (on a daily basis) on my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptopay.me/join/b5728364">CryptoPay</a> account and use the VISA debit card they sent me. During this month I was able to use the VISA to get some cash from a nearby ATM ( 99% of the world ATMs are enabled to use debit cards ), pay some restaurants, coffee, my Netflix subscription and so forth.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2016/05/visa.png" alt="My BTC VISA debit card linked to CryptoPay"></p>
<p>I also had the chance to buy Amazon gift cards directly in BTC using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://giftoff.com/affiliate/55af0d">GiftOff.com</a>, it was fast, easy and secure :)</p>
<p><img src="/images/2016/05/giftoff.png" alt="GiftOff"></p>
<p>From time to time I might need to do bank transfers myself in order to pay bills and my rent, for such purpose I’m using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://bitwa.la/r/N3yjt9qeccjs4qCXc">Bitwala</a> which has a very nice UI and it’s definitely easy to use, they will “transform” your BTC into either USD or EUR and perform a bank transfer for you.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2016/05/bitwala.png" alt="Bitwa.la Account"></p>
<h2 id="Security"><a href="#Security" class="headerlink" title="Security"></a>Security</h2><p>I know I already talked about these points, but <strong>security is vital</strong>, if you want to have all (or most) of your assets stored as BTC, you <strong>have</strong> to use the most secure tools and policies you can, otherwise you might lose everything (hackers, malwares, no backups, you name it).</p>
<ol>
<li>Never store all of your BTC online or on any wallet which is not a Trezor, only move the minimum amount you need every time.</li>
<li>Use a hardware wallet such as the Trezor.</li>
<li>Enable 2FA ( 2 Factory Authentication ) whenever you can.</li>
<li>Backup the recovery words of your hardware wallet in a safe, offline and possibly physical (online is not an option :D) place.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Managing-Price-Volatility"><a href="#Managing-Price-Volatility" class="headerlink" title="Managing Price Volatility"></a>Managing Price Volatility</h2><p>One thing I’ve been asked to clarify is how to manage price volatility, but what we exactly mean with “price volatility” anyway?<br>Long story short, when you <strong>buy</strong> bit coins ( either converting your salary or actively buying them on some exchange ), there’s a specific price which is determined by the market, let’s say you just bought X bit coins which are worth 1000$ (the price you paid for them).</p>
<p>That price might and <strong>will</strong> change in time, so let’s say that after a week the price decreased and your X bit coins are now worth 900$ … you just lost 100$.<br>The opposite might also happen of course, which would make you “earn” something if the price increases instead.</p>
<p>If you have bills to pay, you can’t afford this volatility … what if you have 1000$ of bills to pay but the value of the BTC you have just dropped down to 900$ ?</p>
<p>Keep in mind that having all your money in BTC is mostly a long term investment, but there’re a few ways to ensure that small amounts of your belongings do not change their value so fast.</p>
<p>For instance, if you know you have to pay 1000$ worth of bills, you might want to move all of them to your EUR/USD account on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cryptopay.me/join/b5728364">CryptoPay</a> ( or CoinBase or some exchange ) and keep them there until you spend them.<br>This way they are “frozen” as a fiat currency and they won’t lose any value.<br>There’re also services such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://uphold.com/">UpHold</a> that allow you to do that.</p>
<h2 id="Tools"><a href="#Tools" class="headerlink" title="Tools"></a>Tools</h2><p>In addition to the services that I mentioned, there’re a few other tools I use almost daily.</p>
<h3 id="Mycelium-Android-App"><a href="#Mycelium-Android-App" class="headerlink" title="Mycelium ( Android App )"></a>Mycelium ( Android App )</h3><p>If I need to pay for something while I’m not at home, I use the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet">Mycelium</a> wallet since it’s the only one which correctly interacts with my Trezor using an OTG cable, I do <strong>not</strong> store my BTC on my smartphone, I just use Mycelium as an interface to the Trezor.</p>
<div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g5lwtqsMoAI" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<h3 id="Bitcoinity-Price-Graphs"><a href="#Bitcoinity-Price-Graphs" class="headerlink" title="Bitcoinity ( Price Graphs )"></a>Bitcoinity ( Price Graphs )</h3><p>I constantly keep an eye on the BTC/EUR and BTC/USD prices, so I use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://bitcoinity.org/markets/coinbase/EUR">BitCoinity</a> in order to track different markets/exchanges.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2016/05/bitcoinity.png" alt="Bitcoinity"></p>
<h3 id="r-bitcoin-Reddit-for-News-and-Info-about-BitCoin"><a href="#r-bitcoin-Reddit-for-News-and-Info-about-BitCoin" class="headerlink" title="/r/bitcoin ( Reddit for News and Info about BitCoin )"></a>/r/bitcoin ( Reddit for News and Info about BitCoin )</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin">/r/bitcoin</a> is definitely my preferred way of getting news and various information about what’s happening in the BitCoin world … if I see a significant price increase in some BTC market, Reddit is the first place I go searching for news, comments and suggestions.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2016/05/reddit.png" alt="BitCoin Reddit"></p>
<h2 id="Questions"><a href="#Questions" class="headerlink" title="Questions?"></a>Questions?</h2><p>This is all I’ve got for now, if you have questions or suggestions please feel free to leave a comment and I’ll try to give you an answer ( or integrate your suggestion ) in the next episode :)</p>
<p>If you have some spare BTC and wanna offer me a beer, this is my bitcoin account <code>3Gef69VY8HdhsPghdbipMrepMCKHWukXd3</code> :)</p>
