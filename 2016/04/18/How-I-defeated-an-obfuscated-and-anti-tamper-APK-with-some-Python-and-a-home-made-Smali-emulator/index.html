  <div class="post-content">
    <p>During this Saturday afternoon I was chatting with a friend of mine ( <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/fvrmatteo">Matteo</a> ) and he asked for some help to fix a Python script he was working on.</p>
<p>He was trying to deobfuscate an APK in order to understand its obfuscation and anti tampering (more on this later) protections so I started working on it as well.</p>
<p>This was definitely way more challenging ( and fun! ) than my usual APK reversing session ( dex2jar -&gt; jd-gui -&gt; <strong>done</strong> ), moreover this required me to write a new tool which I find kinda cool and unique ( IMHO of course ), so I’m going to share the story in this post.</p>
<p>I’m going to intentionally skip a few details here and there because I do not want to cause any harm to the people who wrote that application, all the involved protection mechanisms are there to avoid piracy.</p>
<span id="more"></span>

<h2 id="Weird-Characters-Are-Weird"><a href="#Weird-Characters-Are-Weird" class="headerlink" title="Weird Characters Are Weird"></a>Weird Characters Are Weird</h2><p>Like every other reverser who experienced APK decompilation I’m used to Proguard messing with class and method names ( or Dexguard messing with strings, and so forth ), this is not usually a big deal to me, but what I saw when I executed <strong>apktool</strong> was definitely surprising:</p>
<p><img src="/images/2016/04/apktool.png" alt="apktool"></p>
<p><img src="/images/2016/04/wtf.jpeg" alt="wtf"></p>
<p>Most of the classes and methods names were weird binary strings, this almost freezed every single tool or editor I used to inspect those files, so the very first step was to fix ( to be honest, reimplement from scratch XD ) the python script that Matteo was trying to use to rename each obfuscated entry, the script itself was quite simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loop all smali files with non printable names.</li>
<li>Replace the obfuscated class name with <em>ClassXXX</em> ( where XXX is an incremental integer ).</li>
<li>Rename the files.</li>
<li>Search for every references to those classes and patch them with the new names ( regular expressions FTW! ).</li>
<li>Repeat the process against <em>.field</em> directives ( class members, methods, etc ).</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the process, I finally had a browsable folder and readable smali files :)</p>
<p><img src="/images/2016/04/phase1.png" alt="after basic deobfuscation"></p>
<p>But I was definitely far from having done …</p>
<h2 id="Anti-Tampering"><a href="#Anti-Tampering" class="headerlink" title="Anti Tampering"></a>Anti Tampering</h2><p>Before I continue, there’re two things I need to point out in order to make the reasons behind my approach clearer:</p>
<ol>
<li>Matteo told me that the application had some misterious anti tampering ( and most likely anti debugging ) protection, therefore rebuilding the smali to a new APK with some injected code was not possible, neither was debugging.</li>
<li>Such protections not only prevented code injection/modification, but also uninstalled the application if such tampering was detected.</li>
</ol>
<p>So no code injection ( nope, XPosed neither ), no debugging, absolutely no chance to use my standard approach for reversing it :(</p>
<p><img src="/images/2016/04/Okay-Meme-Gif-05.jpg" alt="sad"></p>
<h2 id="Encrypted-Strings"><a href="#Encrypted-Strings" class="headerlink" title="Encrypted Strings"></a>Encrypted Strings</h2><p>As the lazy (or smart, you decide) reverser I am, instead of trying to understand the logic, at first I tried to search for meaningful strings that could give me some hints about what was going on in the app, but again I had a nasty surprise instead.</p>
<p>Every single string was encrypted with a custom algorithm, basically every reference to a string was replaced by something like:</p>
<figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">String decrypted = Class623::method5( <span class="keyword">new</span> <span class="keyword">int</span>[]&#123; -<span class="number">12</span>, <span class="number">44</span>, -<span class="number">35</span>, ... &#125;, <span class="number">52</span> );</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Just a long array of integers and another integer as the second argument (maybe some sort of key?)</p>
<p>What I usually do in these cases is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Decompile the APK to java ( with dex2jar + jd-gui or just jadx ).</li>
<li>Take the java code of the decryption routine and paste it in a stand alone java console application.</li>
<li>Run the decryption routine against the encrypted stuff and eventually get the clear text results.</li>
</ol>
<p>Guess what? Every single tool failed to correctly transform the smali code of <strong>Class623::method5</strong> into java … the output was just nonsense, not working, nada … and for the record I’m not that good in reading smali code (the routine itself was quite complicated, at least for my smali skills) … but I couldn’t just give up … no way!</p>
<p><img src="/images/2016/04/challengeaccepted.jpg" alt="challenge accepted"></p>
<h2 id="All-hail-the-Smali-Emulator"><a href="#All-hail-the-Smali-Emulator" class="headerlink" title="All hail the Smali Emulator"></a>All hail the Smali Emulator</h2><p>Of course I could take the smali code of <strong>Class623::method5</strong>, create a new Android app, decompile it with apktool, inject the smali code of that routine into the output, insert a smali call to that code into the app, rebuild it and launch it … but:</p>
<ol>
<li>Again, I’m <strong>lazy</strong>.</li>
<li>This solution wouldn’t be <strong>elegant</strong>.</li>
<li>A new idea was just born in my head and it was just too cool, I <strong>had</strong> to try it!</li>
</ol>
<p>Long story short, I said to myself:</p>
<pre><code>Fuck this, I&#39;m gonna write a smali parser and emulator and feed it with this
routine, eventually it will output all the cleartexts I need!</code></pre>
<p>So I started reading <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://pallergabor.uw.hu/androidblog/dalvik_opcodes.html">Dalvik opcodes specs</a> ( tnx to <strong>Gabor Paller</strong> for this! ) and putting some code together, after a few hours I had this simple script ready for testing:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">from</span> smali.emulator <span class="keyword">import</span> Emulator</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">emu = Emulator()</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># The smali file to emulate.</span></span><br><span class="line">filename = <span class="string">&#x27;decryptor.smali&#x27;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># Arguments for the method.</span></span><br><span class="line">args = &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="string">&#x27;p0&#x27;</span>: (-<span class="number">62</span>, -<span class="number">99</span>, -<span class="number">106</span>, -<span class="number">125</span>, -<span class="number">123</span>, -<span class="number">105</span>, -<span class="number">98</span>, -<span class="number">37</span>, -<span class="number">105</span>, -<span class="number">97</span>, -<span class="number">103</span>, -<span class="number">41</span>, -<span class="number">118</span>, -<span class="number">97</span>, -<span class="number">113</span>, -<span class="number">103</span>, -<span class="number">109</span>, -<span class="number">104</span>, -<span class="number">115</span>, <span class="number">111</span>, <span class="number">98</span>, <span class="number">103</span>, <span class="number">35</span>, <span class="number">52</span>),</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="string">&#x27;p1&#x27;</span>: <span class="number">19</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">ret = emu.run( filename, args )</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">print</span> emu.stats</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">print</span> <span class="string">&quot;RESULT:\n&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">print</span> <span class="string">&quot;&#x27;%s&#x27;&quot;</span> % ret</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Aaaaaaand:</p>
<p><img src="/images/2016/04/pwned.png" alt="decrypted"></p>
<p><strong>BINGO!!!</strong></p>
<p>I executed the script against every encrypted string and it worked like a charm, the emulator was able to correctly parse and execute the smali code of the decryption routine and decrypt every single entry I’ve extracted from the decompiled application … from that point on it was just a matter of replacing encrypted entries with their cleartexts and the reversing process became as easy as pie :)</p>
<p><img src="/images/2016/04/victory.jpg" alt="victory"></p>
<h2 id="Conclusions"><a href="#Conclusions" class="headerlink" title="Conclusions"></a>Conclusions</h2><p>I’ve released the code on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/evilsocket/smali_emulator">github</a> as usual, it still lacks the support for a lot of Dalvik opcodes, I’ve just implemented the ones I needed in order to emulate that routine ( which you can find in the repo as well ), but it’s quite easy to improve it and probably I’ll complete it in the next few days :)</p>
